# Keeper

Keeper is a simple image store for Appocular. It indexes images by
their image data, so each image is only stored once.

It is idempotent, so storing the same image will simply return the
same Keeper URL.

## Images resource [/image]

### Add image [POST]

Add an image to the image store. This is idempotent, if the image is
already stored, the return URL is the same.

Caller needs to athenticate with a shared token.
